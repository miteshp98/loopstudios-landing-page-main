## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

I recently completed a responsive landing page project for Loopstudios using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Through this project, I gained deeper insights into working with media queries, the picture element, and responsive image handling to ensure an optimal viewing experience across different screen sizes. I also honed my skills in CSS Grid and Flexbox for creating a dynamic, grid-based layout. Additionally, I improved my understanding of CSS transitions and animations to enhance user interactivity, such as hover effects on navigation links and cards.

```js
toggleButton.addEventListener("click", toggleNavbar);

function toggleNavbar() {
  if (!navbar.classList.contains("toggle")) {
    navbar.classList.add("toggle");
    body.style.overflow = "hidden";
    toggleIcon.src = "images/icon-close.svg";
  } else {
    navbar.classList.remove("toggle");
    body.style.overflow = "auto";
    toggleIcon.src = "images/icon-hamburger.svg";
  }
}
```

### Continued development

Moving forward, I plan to delve further into advanced CSS techniques, such as CSS variables for better theme management and custom properties for greater design consistency. I will also explore JavaScript frameworks like React to streamline the development of more complex, interactive user interfaces. Moreover, I intend to implement accessibility best practices to ensure that my projects are usable by a wider audience, regardless of their abilities or devices
